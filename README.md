Read me
=======

I have contributed with a few patches to different open-source
projects througout the years. Unfortunately, I haven't stored
them somewhere. Among the projects have been:

 * Zend Framework
 * Yii Framework
 * WikyBlog
 * Lithium Framework

This is a "private" project ment to keep track of all of my patches.

Please note, I don't include patches for forks I've created here on
github, which I send pull requests upstream afterwards.
