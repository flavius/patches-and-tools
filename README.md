Read me
=======

I have contributed with a few patches to different open-source
projects througout the years. Unfortunately, I haven't stored
them somewhere. Among the projects have been:

 * Zend Framework
 * Yii Framework
 * WikyBlog
 * Lithium Framework
 * Pyrus

I also keep here small tools and scripts I've written, some of them
are useless, others are for a specific type of usage under a
controlled environment.

**USE THEM AT _YOUR OWN_ RISK!**

This is a "private" project ment to keep track of all of my patches
and of all of my "utilities".

*Feel free to submit bug reports or patches!*

Please note, I don't include patches for forks I've created here on
github, which I send pull requests upstream afterwards.

You'll have to keep track of them directly.
