"""Set channel priority

Based on the idea of Flavius Aspra <flavius.as@gmail.com>

When joining channels the buffers will be arranged from high to low priority.
Buffers containing high-priority channels will be in the head of the list:
Positions: 2, 3, 4, ...
They will be followed by low (normal) priority channels.

High-priority channels must be set using this command:
    /chanpriority [#channels]+

The argument must be a list of channels separated by commas, e.g.:
    /chanpriority #chan1,#chan2,#chan3
